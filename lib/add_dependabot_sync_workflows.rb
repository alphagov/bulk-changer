TITLE = "Create workflow to copy PR template onto Dependabot PRs"
DESCRIPTION = <<~EOF
  This repo contains a pull request template. However, PRs raised by Dependabot will not use this template. This could mean that PR reviewers might miss crucial information about the test suite, or about any manual steps that must be performed pre- or post- merge.

  This PR adds a GitHub Actions workflow that will post the PR template as a comment on every PR that Dependabot raises.
